# PracticalWebAnimation

About:

This is a collection of the CSS and JQuery web animations done during the Tuts+ course Practical Web Animation by Craig Campbell. This is a very good course with many great examples. 

Unfortunately, he did everything on Codepen, which I'm not a huge fan of and I wanted stuff stored locally so I can easily reference them.

Therefore, while following the course I did them using full formatting (something Codepen doesn't do) using VS Code.

Issues:

-Because I just copied the files down each time as a base to start the next project, there are sometimes script and/or link files that aren't actually used in the project. Maybe one day I'll fix these, maybe not.
-Course is not yet finished, but I will be updating over the next few days.

Why are these public? 

Because I figured others might want to see them as well. It's actually pretty hard to find examples of how to do CSS animations. I was delighted not only to find this course, but to have these examples be of a quality I would actually want to use in my own projects. 

Why are there no comments on what each line is doing?

I don't want to tread on Craig's shoes too much. If you want explanations and the reasoning behind why things are laid out as they are, you're going to have to watch his videos. Again, they are highly recommended. This repo is more of a quick reference after you watch the course than a replacement for the course. 

Why is section 1 missing?

Because section 1 was just an introduction to the course and to using Codepen. There's no real code for it.
